# CIS-5-Lab-01
Lab 01 Hello World

SUMMARY

For this lab I used Visual Studio 2026 and the Github Desktop application. I cloned my repository directly into Visual Studio. For this lab, I created a main.cpp file. I then declared the namespace std at the top for COUT and ENDL as demonstrated in the Lab 01 video. I created a main function to run all the code. I then used COUT to output the string "Hello World!".
